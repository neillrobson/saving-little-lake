# Saving Little Lake

> A turtle colony's quest to reclaim their homeland.

This game is meant to be an artistic re-imagining of Markus "Notch" Persson's
_Breaking the Tower_. The developer's goals are:

0. To gain comfort developing simple video games in Haxe, OpenFL, and
   HaxeFlixel.
1. To create a meaningful and personalized gift for friends and family.

The first attempt at this project was a pure re-implementation of Notch's
original game in "raw" OpenFL. That attempt can be found
[here](https://github.com/neillrobson/open-tower). It is basically
feature-complete, but in need of significant refactoring to raise the efficiency
and elegance of the code to a reasonable level.

This attempt is intended to be an original game inspired by Notch's work. All
art, sound, and music will be made by the developer, and the gameplay will also
be original (though heavily influenced by the original game). This re-imagining
will also be developed in the HaxeFlixel game engine, both to increase
efficiency in development and to help the developer learn some of the best
practices and architectures necessary to improve the code of the OpenFL
implementation.
